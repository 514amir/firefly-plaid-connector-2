/**
 * Contains details about a security
 *
 * @param securityId A unique, Plaid-specific identifier for the security, used to associate securities with holdings. Like all Plaid identifiers, the `security_id` is case sensitive.
 * @param isin 12-character ISIN, a globally unique securities identifier.
 * @param cusip 9-character CUSIP, an identifier assigned to North American securities.
 * @param sedol 7-character SEDOL, an identifier assigned to securities in the UK.
 * @param institutionSecurityId An identifier given to the security by the institution
 * @param institutionId If `institution_security_id` is present, this field indicates the Plaid `institution_id` of the institution to whom the identifier belongs.
 * @param proxySecurityId In certain cases, Plaid will provide the ID of another security whose performance resembles this security, typically when the original security has low volume, or when a private security can be modeled with a publicly traded security.
 * @param name A descriptive name for the security, suitable for display.
 * @param tickerSymbol The security’s trading symbol for publicly traded securities, and otherwise a short identifier if available.
 * @param isCashEquivalent Indicates that a security is a highly liquid asset and can be treated like cash.
 * @param type The security type of the holding. Valid security types are:  `cash`: Cash, currency, and money market funds  `cryptocurrency`: Digital or virtual currencies  `derivative`: Options, warrants, and other derivative instruments  `equity`: Domestic and foreign equities  `etf`: Multi-asset exchange-traded investment funds  `fixed income`: Bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs)  `loan`: Loans and loan receivables  `mutual fund`: Open- and closed-end vehicles pooling funds of multiple investors  `other`: Unknown or other investment types
 * @param closePrice Price of the security at the close of the previous trading session. Null for non-public securities.  If the security is a foreign currency this field will be updated daily and will be priced in USD.  If the security is a cryptocurrency, this field will be updated multiple times a day. As crypto prices can fluctuate quickly and data may become stale sooner than other asset classes, please refer to update_datetime with the time when the price was last updated.
 * @param closePriceAsOf Date for which `close_price` is accurate. Always `null` if `close_price` is `null`.
 * @param isoCurrencyCode The ISO-4217 currency code of the price given. Always `null` if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-`null`.
 * @param unofficialCurrencyCode The unofficial currency code associated with the security. Always `null` if `iso_currency_code` is non-`null`. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `iso_currency_code`s.
 * @param updateDatetime Date and time at which close_price is accurate, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ). Always null if close_price is null.
