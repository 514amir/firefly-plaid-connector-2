/**
 * The transactions data for the end user's income source(s).
 *
 * @param amount The settled value of the transaction, denominated in the transactions's currency as stated in `iso_currency_code` or `unofficial_currency_code`. Positive values when money moves out of the account; negative values when money moves in. For example, credit card purchases are positive; credit card payment, direct deposits, and refunds are negative.
 * @param date For pending transactions, the date that the transaction occurred; for posted transactions, the date that the transaction posted. Both dates are returned in an ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
 * @param name The merchant name or transaction description.
 * @param originalDescription The string returned by the financial institution to describe the transaction.
 * @param pending When true, identifies the transaction as pending or unsettled. Pending transaction details (name, type, amount, category ID) may change before they are settled.
 * @param transactionId The unique ID of the transaction. Like all Plaid identifiers, the `transaction_id` is case sensitive.
 * @param checkNumber The check number of the transaction. This field is only populated for check transactions.
 * @param isoCurrencyCode The ISO 4217 currency code of the amount or balance.
 * @param unofficialCurrencyCode The unofficial currency code associated with the amount or balance. Always `null` if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.
