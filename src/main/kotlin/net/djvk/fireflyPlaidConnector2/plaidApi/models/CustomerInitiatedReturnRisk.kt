/**
 * The object contains a risk score and a risk tier that evaluate the transaction return risk of an unauthorized debit. Common return codes in this category include: \"R05\", \"R07\", \"R10\", \"R11\", \"R29\". These returns typically have a return time frame of up to 60 calendar days. During this period, the customer of financial institutions can dispute a transaction as unauthorized.
 *
 * @param score A score from 1-99 that indicates the transaction return risk: a higher risk score suggests a higher return likelihood.
 * @param riskTier A tier corresponding to the projected likelihood that the transaction, if initiated, will be subject to a return.  In the `customer_initiated_return_risk` object, there are five risk tiers corresponding to the scores:   1: Predicted customer-initiated return incidence rate between 0.00% - 0.02%   2: Predicted customer-initiated return incidence rate between 0.02% - 0.05%   3: Predicted customer-initiated return incidence rate between 0.05% - 0.1%   4: Predicted customer-initiated return incidence rate between 0.1% - 0.5%   5: Predicted customer-initiated return incidence rate greater than 0.5%
