/**
 * Contains details about a student loan account
 *
 * @param accountId The ID of the account that this liability belongs to.
 * @param accountNumber The account number of the loan. For some institutions, this may be a masked version of the number (e.g., the last 4 digits instead of the entire number).
 * @param disbursementDates The dates on which loaned funds were disbursed or will be disbursed. These are often in the past. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD).
 * @param expectedPayoffDate The date when the student loan is expected to be paid off. Availability for this field is limited. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD).
 * @param guarantor The guarantor of the student loan.
 * @param interestRatePercentage The interest rate on the loan as a percentage.
 * @param isOverdue `true` if a payment is currently overdue. Availability for this field is limited.
 * @param lastPaymentAmount The amount of the last payment.
 * @param lastPaymentDate The date of the last payment. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD).
 * @param lastStatementIssueDate The date of the last statement. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD).
 * @param loanName The type of loan, e.g., \"Consolidation Loans\".
 * @param loanStatus
 * @param minimumPaymentAmount The minimum payment due for the next billing cycle. There are some exceptions: Some institutions require a minimum payment across all loans associated with an account number. Our API presents that same minimum payment amount on each loan. The institutions that do this are: Great Lakes ( `ins_116861`), Firstmark (`ins_116295`), Commonbond Firstmark Services (`ins_116950`), Nelnet (`ins_116528`), EdFinancial Services (`ins_116304`), Granite State (`ins_116308`), and Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (`ins_116945`). Firstmark (`ins_116295` ) and Navient (`ins_116248`) will display as $0 if there is an autopay program in effect.
 * @param nextPaymentDueDate The due date for the next payment. The due date is `null` if a payment is not expected. A payment is not expected if `loan_status.type` is `deferment`, `in_school`, `consolidated`, `paid in full`, or `transferred`. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD).
 * @param originationDate The date on which the loan was initially lent. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD).
 * @param originationPrincipalAmount The original principal balance of the loan.
 * @param outstandingInterestAmount The total dollar amount of the accrued interest balance. For Sallie Mae ( `ins_116944`), this amount is included in the current balance of the loan, so this field will return as `null`.
 * @param paymentReferenceNumber The relevant account number that should be used to reference this loan for payments. In the majority of cases, `payment_reference_number` will match a`ccount_number,` but in some institutions, such as Great Lakes (`ins_116861`), it will be different.
 * @param pslfStatus
 * @param repaymentPlan
 * @param sequenceNumber The sequence number of the student loan. Heartland ECSI (`ins_116948`) does not make this field available.
 * @param servicerAddress
 * @param ytdInterestPaid The year to date (YTD) interest paid. Availability for this field is limited.
 * @param ytdPrincipalPaid The year to date (YTD) principal paid. Availability for this field is limited.
