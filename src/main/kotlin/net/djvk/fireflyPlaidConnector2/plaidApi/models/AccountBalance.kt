/**
 * A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.
 *
 * @param available The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.  For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.  For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.  For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.  Note that not all institutions calculate the `available`  balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.  Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.  If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.
 * @param current The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.  For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.  For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.  For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.  Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get`.  When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.
 * @param limit For `credit`-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.  For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.  In North America, this field is typically only available for `credit`-type accounts.
 * @param isoCurrencyCode The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-null.
 * @param unofficialCurrencyCode The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if `iso_currency_code` is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `unofficial_currency_code`s.
 * @param lastUpdatedDatetime Timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`) indicating the last time that the balance for the given account has been updated  This is currently only provided when the `min_last_updated_datetime` is passed when calling `/accounts/balance/get` for `ins_128026` (Capital One).
