/**
 * Specifies options for initializing Link for use with the Income (beta) product. This field is required if `income_verification` is included in the `products` array.
 *
 * @param incomeVerificationId The `income_verification_id` of the verification instance, as provided by `/income/verification/create`.
 * @param assetReportId The `asset_report_id` of an asset report associated with the user, as provided by `/asset_report/create`. Providing an `asset_report_id` is optional and can be used to verify the user through a streamlined flow. If provided, the bank linking flow will be skipped.
 * @param precheckId The ID of a precheck created with `/income/verification/precheck`. Will be used to improve conversion of the income verification flow by streamlining the Link interface presented to the end user.
 * @param accessTokens An array of access tokens corresponding to Items that a user has previously connected with. Data from these institutions will be cross-referenced with document data received during the Document Income flow to help verify that the uploaded documents are accurate. If the `transactions` product was not initialized for these Items during link, it will be initialized after this Link session.  This field should only be used with the `payroll` income source type.
 * @param incomeSourceTypes The types of source income data that users will be permitted to share. Options include `bank` and `payroll`. Currently you can only specify one of these options.
 * @param bankIncome
 * @param payrollIncome
 * @param statedIncomeSources A list of user stated income sources
