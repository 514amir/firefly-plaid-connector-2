/**
 * A securities holding at an institution.
 *
 * @param accountId The Plaid `account_id` associated with the holding.
 * @param securityId The Plaid `security_id` associated with the holding.
 * @param institutionPrice The last price given by the institution for this security.
 * @param institutionPriceAsOf The date at which `institution_price` was current.
 * @param institutionValue The value of the holding, as reported by the institution.
 * @param costBasis The original total value or the purchase price per share of the holding. This field is an aggregate on a per holding basis and dependent on the information provided by the institution.
 * @param quantity The total quantity of the asset held, as reported by the financial institution. If the security is an option, `quantity` will reflect the total number of options (typically the number of contracts multiplied by 100), not the number of contracts.
 * @param isoCurrencyCode The ISO-4217 currency code of the holding. Always `null` if `unofficial_currency_code` is non-`null`.
 * @param unofficialCurrencyCode The unofficial currency code associated with the holding. Always `null` if `iso_currency_code` is non-`null`. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.  See the [currency code schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#currency-code-schema) for a full listing of supported `iso_currency_code`s.
 * @param institutionPriceDatetime Date and time at which `institution_price` was current, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ).  This field is returned for select financial institutions and comes as provided by the institution. It may contain default time values (such as 00:00:00).
