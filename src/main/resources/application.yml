    # Transaction categorization configuration (optional, defaults to disable categorization)
    # Plaid currently supplies two types of categorization information https://plaid.com/blog/transactions-categorization-taxonomy/
    # For either categorization type, all provided categories for a given transaction (there can be more than one)
    #   will be added as tags to the Firefly transaction using the prefixes below.
    # This is intended to allow you to use Firefly's rule engine to add the transaction to a budget or category or whatever,
    #   rather than trying to squeeze all that logic in here.

      # Add old Plaid categorization information (transaction.category) as tags to Firefly transactions
      # Optional, disabled if omitted.
